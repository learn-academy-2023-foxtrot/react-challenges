PLAN:
-we need to create an unordered list (with the prices of each item) this means that we need an object
-we will use state to make an array inside of an object 
-we will use .map to iterate through the array to display our menu items

-useState needs to live in App.js
-we will need to create a component where map can live. 
-we need to use props to share useState with the component menu
-we then need to use functional props to return .map to App.js
