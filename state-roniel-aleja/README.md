- Created component Box.js and App.js
- exported the Box.js component in the App.js
- Within the Box.js component we created a function and we called the component in the App component <>
- In the box we created a div with a p tag and a button 
- In the div we created a class named Box 
- we styled a box in css
- We imported state from React
- We used state in a variable and used State and useState: had white as a parameter call
- we made a variable called Color, which was an array of different colors
- we made a function called change color and we add a random with math.floor and math.random
- we set up a variable to call the colors 
- in the p tag we added the colors variable and added a button so onclick we could change color and a text that says change color

<!-- CHALLENGES: As a user, I can see a square box on the screen with a black border and a white background.
As a user, I can see the default color name "white" inside the box.
As a user, every time I click on the box the name of a different color appears.
Possible color names: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink
As a user, every time I click the box instead of the color name, I see the background color in the box change to represent the color.
As a user, I can see many boxes on the page all acting independently of one another. -->

- to change the background color in the box component we added inline style to change the background color and we used double curly brakets to pass through JSX and go to css {{}}
