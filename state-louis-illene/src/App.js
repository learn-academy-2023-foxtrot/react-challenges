// As a user, I can see a square box on the screen with a black border and a white background.
// As a user, I can see the default color name "white" inside the box.
// As a user, every time I click on the box the name of a different color appears.
// Possible color names: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink
// As a user, every time I click the box instead of the color name, I see the background color in the box change to represent the color.
// As a user, I can see many boxes on the page all acting independently of one another.
